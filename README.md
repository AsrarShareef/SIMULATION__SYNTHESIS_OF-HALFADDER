Aim:-  TO DO SIMULATION OF HALFADDER.https://www.edaplayground.com/x/py7z
SOFTWARES REQUIRED:- GITHUB & EDAPLAYGROUNDS.
PROCESS/PROCEDURE:- 1)OPEN THE “GITHUB.COM/VISION-VLSI” IN GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE.
 
FIG1 SHOWS THE HOME PAGE OF THE GITHUB.
2)ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OVERVIEW WE SEE “REPOSITORIES”.
 
FIG2 SHOWS THE REPOSITORIES OPTION
3)AS WEE CLICK ON REPOSITORIES WE SEE “VERILOG” TERM.
 
FIG3 SHOWS THE VERILOG TERM
4) NOW CLICK ON VERILOG AND WE SEE THE LIST OF CONTENT AS BELOW
 
FIG4 SHOWS THE LIST OF CONTENT
5)NOW CLICK ON “COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS” FROM THE CONTENT LIST 
FIG5 SHOWS THE COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT OPTION

6)AS WE CLICK ON COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT WE GET THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GATE MODELLING 
FIG7 SHOWS THE LEVEL MODELING
7)NOW CLICK ON 2 GATE LEVEL MODELLING AND WE GET THE LIST OF GATES WHICH WE WANT TO DO SIMULATION 
FIG8 SHOWS FIG8THE LIST OF GATES FOR SIMULATION
9)NOW CLICK ON FULLADDER AS WE CLICK ON HALFADDERVWE GET THE DESIGN CODE AND TESTBENCH CODE FOR HALFADDER SIMULATION.
 
FIG9 SHOWS THE DESIGN.SV CODE FOR HALFADDER.
 
FIG9 SHOWS THE TESTBENCH.SV CODE FOR HALFADDER.
10) NOW COPPY THE CODES AND PASTE THEM IN THE EDAPLAYGROUNDS AT THERE RESPECTIVE AREAS.
 
FIG10 SHOWS THE CODES IN RESPECTIVE AREAS IN EDAPLAYGROUNDS.
11)NOW SAVE IT AND SELECT THE TOOL FOR SIMULATION.
 
FIG 11SHOWS THE TOOL FOR SIMULATION OF HALFADDER.
12)NOW AGAIN SAVE IT AND RUN IT WE GET THE EPWAVE  i.e  THE OUTPUT
